Understand the problem

  Identify inputs and outputs
  Identify implicit concepts
  Determine rules
  high level overview of what needs to occurs and how it will be accomplished

Examples / Test Cases

  What is the expected output for this example input? Create a few test cases

Data Structure

  What we are using to convert input to output

  consider the language

  consider the mental model along side the algorithm

  in enough detail that we know how to write it in code


PEDA steps are interchangale

The key is to understand the problem and then code with intent. Unserstand before taking action

unless you test/validate, its very difficult to know if you missed anything
